    "> Glycans are a fundamental biological sequence, similar to DNA, RNA, or proteins. Glycans are complex carbohydrates that can form branched structures comprising monosaccharides and linkages as constituents. Despite being conspicuously absent from most research, glycans are ubiquitous in biology. They decorate most proteins and lipids and direct the stability and functions of biomolecules, cells, and organisms. This also makes glycans relevant to every human disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The analysis of glycans is made difficult by their nonlinearity and their astounding diversity, given the large number of monosaccharides and types of linkages. Glycowork is a Python package designed to process and analyze glycan sequences, with a special emphasis on glycan-focused machine learning. Next to various functions to work with glycans, Glycowork also contains glycan data that can be used for glycan alignments, model pre-training, motif comparisons, etc."
