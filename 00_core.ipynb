    "# Glycowork\n",
    "\n",
    "> Glycans are a fundamental biological sequence, similar to DNA, RNA, or proteins. Glycans are complex carbohydrates that can form branched structures comprising monosaccharides and linkages as constituents. Despite being conspicuously absent from most research, glycans are ubiquitous in biology. They decorate most proteins and lipids and direct the stability and functions of biomolecules, cells, and organisms. This also makes glycans relevant to every human disease."

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "The analysis of glycans is made difficult by their nonlinearity and their astounding diversity, given the large number of monosaccharides and types of linkages. Glycowork is a Python package designed to process and analyze glycan sequences, with a special emphasis on glycan-focused machine learning. Next to various functions to work with glycans, Glycowork also contains glycan data that can be used for glycan alignments, model pre-training, motif comparisons, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where possible, glycowork uses the IUPAC-condensed nomenclature for glycan. An example for this would be `Man(a1-3)[Man(a1-6)]Man(b1-4)GlcNAc(b1-4)GlcNAc`, in which parentheses enclose the linkage description and brackets indicate branches. Ideally, the longest branch should constitute the main chain and side branches should be ordered ascendingly based on the last linkage of the branch (yet all functions in glycowork can deal with violations to these guidelines). Where possible/known, monosaccharide modifications are indicated by the ring position to which they are attached (e.g., Glc6Me), while the type of connection is given if the exact position is unknown (e.g., GlcOMe). Linkage uncertainty is usually expressed with a 'bond' placeholder. As suggested in IUPAC-condensed, we omit the D-/L-prefix for the \"usual\" case and only add it for the rarer option (e.g., Glc vs. L-Glc).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it should be noted that nearly all functions in glycowork operate on pure graphs (facilitated by `glycan_to_graph`), avoiding all ambiguity of the IUPAC nomenclature. We use the IUPAC nomenclature here as a human-readable glycan nomenclature that can be readily used for motif interpretation and user-friendly usage. The conversion to graphs in all end user - functions and operations such as motif annotation via subgraph isomorphism tests are handled behind the scenes, allowing you to work with glycans in a human-readable format."
