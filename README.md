# Glycowork - A package with helper functions for the processing and analysis of glycan sequences

Contains various helper functions for working with glycan sequences, mostly adapted from [Bojar et al., 2020](https://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/fulltext/S1931-3128(20)30562-X) and [Burkholz et al., 2021](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.01.433491v1).
